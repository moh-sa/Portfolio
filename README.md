  <h3 align="center">M S A Portfolio</h3>

  <p align="center">
  One of my top priorities was developing an accessible portfolio for all users, regardless of any visual limitations they may have. To achieve this goal, I have used color schemes that are friendly for those who are colorblind, and I have made sure to be in compliance with WCAG standards. Utilizing the latest features of Next.js 13 and Native CSS, I have brought my vision to life with a minimalist design that sets my work apart from others.
